# Hi, I'm Rakshith Kotian! 👋  

## 🖥️ CLI-Driven Projects 🚀
All my projects are managed entirely through the **command line interface (CLI)**.  
I use **Git CLI**, **Linux commands**, and **shell scripting** for deployment, automation, and version control.

### 🔹 Key CLI Skills:
- **Git CLI:** Repository management, commits, branches, pushing/pulling  
- **Linux CLI:** Server setup, automation  
- **AWS CLI:** Managing EC2, S3, and IAM roles via commands  

> **💡 Fun fact:** Every project in my repositories was set up, modified, and deployed using the CLI—no GUI tools!  

### 📌 My Repositories:
- 🔹 [AWS-Linux](https://github.com/Rakshithk1/aws-linux) – AWS & Linux Projects  
- 🔹 [Linux Commands](https://github.com/Rakshithk1/linux-cmds) – Essential Linux commands
